# QuantumMachineLearning
This project is divided in two parts:
1. Utilizing Neural Networks to sort signal from background processes in high energy particle collisions
2. Utilizing variational circuits, also called Quantum Neural Networks, to do the same task
This is a special curriculum project at UiO. The task to sort signal from background processes is from the Higgs boson Machine Learning challenge from 2014. 
Part 1 used the Python library TensorFlow to make the Neural Network. 
Part 2 used the Python library Qiskit to simulate a quantum circuit to do quantum machine learning. 
The results and full project is in the pfd file, enjoy!
